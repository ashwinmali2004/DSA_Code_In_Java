Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a type of graph in which follwing properties are followed:

1) N nodes.
2) N-1 edges.
3) undirected graph
4) No cycle
5) single component

There are Mainly two Algorithms in MST:
1) PRIM'S Algorithm
2) KRUSKAL's Algorithm

It is used to find the shortest path from src to dst node.
